# weibull_analysis
Analysis code used in [Kirsten et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05101) for burst wait time distribution. To use code, clone into a directory and run python3 create_posterior.py. This will generate a pickle file of the posterior distribution in the same directory. Then run python3 weibull.py to generate the plot.
